# .gitignore for WordPress
# Bare Minimum Git
# Originaly from http://ironco.de/bare-minimum-git/
# ver 20150130
#
# This file is tailored for a WordPress project 
# using the default directory structure
#
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
# http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore
#
# NOTES:
# The purpose of gitignore files is to ensure that certain files not
# tracked by Git remain untracked.
#
# To ignore uncommitted changes in a file that is already tracked,
# use `git update-index --assume-unchanged`.
#
# To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked,
# use `git rm --cached`
#
